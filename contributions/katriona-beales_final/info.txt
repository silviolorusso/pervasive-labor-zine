Ace! I'll send you details of the book (by my bedside at home at the moment). Perhaps some contextual info about the wider body of work would be helpful - happy for you to pull this together from what i have sent you? 

The book I reference is called 'Neuromarketing in action - how to talk and sell to the brain' (2014) by Patrick M Georges, Anne- Sophie Bayle-Tourtoulou and Michel Badoc
