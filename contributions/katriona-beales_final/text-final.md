Banner designed for the exhibition 'Are We All Addicts Now?', taking place at Furtherfield (London). In the show, Katriona Beals looks at online behavioural addictions and digital dependencies, conditions that are exacerbated by the demands of precarious working conditions within network culture. The phrase 'stress the mother of all emotions' comes from *Neuromarketing in Action - How to Talk and Sell to the Brain* (2014) by Georges, Bayle-Tourtoulou and Badoc. It acts as heading for a book section explaining how to force consumers to make decisions quickly by raising stress levels.
