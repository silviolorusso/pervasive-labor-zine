# Pervasive Labour Union zine #11: Entreprecariat (almost there!)

Dear contributor,

while we are busy with putting together the zine, we would like to thank you once again for your contribution. 

We are glad to announce that the zine will include 22 contributions by Anxious to Make, Katriona Beals, Giacomo Boffo, Juliette Cezzar, Michael Dieter, Lucia Dossin, Max Dovey, eeefff, Evening Class, Martine Folkersma, Olivier Fournout, François Girard-Meunier, Alina Lupu, Gui Machiavelli, Melissa Mesku, Phoebe Moore, Martin Mueller, Nefula, Phil N/A, Lídia Pereira, Priya Prabhakar and Jamie Woodcock. 

The content of the zine will be licensed under the GNU Free Documentation License 1.3 (https://www.gnu.org/licenses/fdl-1.3.en.html). In case you prefer another type of license, please let us know. 

We are also considering the possibility of sending a printed copy of the zine to each of you. We're still figuring out how to do so since, given the unexpectedly high amount of pages, simply stapling a folded booklet might not work. In any case, it would be great if you could already send us an address where to ship the zine. 

Looking forward!

Best,

Silvio and Lídia
